# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe. The game of the refined gentleman or lady. Now also open to AIs.

The program trains two AIs (one going first, the other going second) using after states for one and pure Q-learning 
for the other. The Q-learning AI is not told of the rules and will need to learn not to place tokens on top of other tokens 
for instance.

Once trained, you, the refined gentleman or lady, can play against the AIs.
